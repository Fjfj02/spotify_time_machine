# Spotify Time Machine

## Purpose

This project aims to make a playlist that reminds you of a certain era, so the best way to do this was using Spotify.

It was based on the same course as other projects that are on my GitHub.

## Overview


It basically asks you for a date, on the terminal, in the format YYYY-MM-DD so that it can get the most played songs on Billboard that day. Generating the playlist as follows on your Spotify:

</p> 

## Run code

First, you must research and create keys in the Spotify API and place them in the code.

You have to install the following libraries:

```shell
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install spotipy
```

To run the code, use:

```shell
python3 main.py
```

So, just enter the date you want to travel.
